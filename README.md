# American sign language identification using hand trackpoint analysis
**ABSTRACT**

Sign Language helps people with Speaking and Hearing Disabilities com-municate with others efficiently. Sign Language identification is a challenging area in the field of computer vision and recent developments have been able to achieve near perfect results for the task, though some challenges are yet to be solved. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning based pipeline for American Sign Language identification using hand track points. We convert a hand gesture into a series of hand track point coordinates that serve as an in-put to our system. In order to make the solution more efficient, we experi-mented with 28 different combinations of pre-processing techniques, each run on three different machine learning algorithms namely k-Nearest Neighbours, Random Forests and a Neural Network. Their performance was contrasted to determine the best pre-processing scheme and algorithm pair. Our system achieved an Accuracy of 95.66% to identify American sign language gestures.
